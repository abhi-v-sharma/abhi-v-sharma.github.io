title: Site Launch and Embarking on an Adventure
---
I'm really excited to start building on this newer, sleeker version of the site. I'm a sucker for
the new minimalist, modernist thing. Right now, you'll notice only this notes tab and the home page work. 
That's because, in addition to the project I'll be adding to my log below, this site is itself an ongoing project for me.
I look to add to the CV and contact pages soon, along with adding in little features here and there.
I hope you like the look and feel of the site. Reach out to me via email if you have any comments or suggestions.

Now, the first big project I'll be embarking on is one I'm pretty excited about. It's called [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/)
and they provide awesome structured course paths for amateur coders to get certifications in key areas, and all the while
help non-profits build up technology to better serve their cause. It's absolutely fantastic, and I would recommend it to anyone with any level
of coding experience. After all, you're helping some of the best causes in the world! They're also on [github](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp),
so check them out.
