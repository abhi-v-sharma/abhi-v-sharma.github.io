title: Creating A New Project
---
Hey guys! I've recently been inspired to build a new project, so this will be my opportunity to revisit my git
skills and full stack dev toolbox. I'll finally get around to figuring out how github project pages work,
and hopefully I'll be able to put together a prototype of the thing that's been bouncing around in my head
for the last few days. I'll be using github as a chassis, bootstrap and jekyll, and learning how to incorporate
MySQL and php into the project as well as refreshing all of the nifty basic HTML/CSS stuff I already know.

Hope this works out. This post is a pseudo test, just to see if I remember the basics of git. It's been a while!
