title: Meet My New Friend, SteinbeckBot!
---
Long time no see. This school year I've been working on a lot more hardware projects than I have software, but I've been wanting to build a Twitter bot for some time. With some help from the internet, it took me less than an hour to build [SteinbeckBot](https://twitter.com/SteinbeckBot). Just a little afternoon project. 

Huge thanks to [Zach Whalen](http://www.zachwhalen.net/)
and his really cool tool, [SSbot](http://www.zachwhalen.net/posts/how-to-make-a-twitter-bot-with-google-spreadsheets-version-04/). Of course, my understanding of the Markov chain wouldn't have been possible without the help of [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com).
